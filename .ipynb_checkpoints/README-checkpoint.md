# week-6-lab
Cameron Gearhart & Dominique Mittermeier

Week-6-Lab is a simple python program that tells you if you're old enough to consume alcohol. It asks for your name and age, then checks your age against our set variables, and returns a message. This message will tell you if you're old enough to drink alcohol or not.
