# week-6-lab

Week-6-Lab is a simple python program that tells you if you're old enough to consume alcohol.

The only two peices of information we will need is your name and age. This is how you tell us that information. 

```name = input("What is your name?")```
```age = input("Please tell me your age.")```

A box will pop up for each of these statements and you will type your answer and then push enter.

We then check your age against our set variables, and we return a message. This message will tell you if you're old enough to drink alcohol or not. :) 

So to get this code for yourself you will have to open a terminal. 
Copy the code below into your terminal once you get to the directory you want it in. 

```git clone https://github.com/cwgearhart/week-6-lab.git```

This will copy our folder into your JupyterLab. Now you can use and change this code. 

Speaking of changing the code, we are an open source project. Therefor we would love to have your contributions. If you have the urge to add you will just have to submit a push. The following steps will help you submit that push: 

1. ```git add .``` 
2. ```git commit -m "add your own comments here so we can check out what you changed"```
3. ```git push origin master```
4. Now it will ask you for your GitHub login and password. Enter those. Then it will update on our end. 

We appreciate all and any contributions and we hope you have fun!
