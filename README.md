Week-6-Lab is a simple python program that tells you if you're old enough to consume alcohol.

The only two peices of information we will need is your name and age. This is how you tell us that information. 

```name = input("What is your name?")```

A box will pop up for each of these statements and you will type your answer and then push enter.

```age = input("Please tell me your age.")```

We then check your age against our set variables, and we return a message. This message will tell you if you're old enough to drink alcohol or not. :)
